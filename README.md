In this assignment, we will learn to train object detectors in the *weakly supervised* setting, which means you're going to train object detectors without bounding box annotations!

We will use the [PyTorch](pytorch.org) framework to design our models, train and test them. We will also be using [Weights and Biases](https://wandb.ai/site) for visualizations and to log our metrics. This assignment borrows heavily from the [previous version](https://bitbucket.org/cmu16824_spring2020/2020_hw2_release/src/master/), but is now upgraded to Python 3, and does not depend upon the now deprecated Faster-RCNN repository.

We will be implementing slightly simplified versions of the following approaches in this assignment:

1. Oquab, Maxime, et al. "*Is object localization for free?-weakly-supervised learning with convolutional neural networks.*" Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2015. [Link](https://www.di.ens.fr/~josef/publications/Oquab15.pdf)
2. Bilen, Hakan, and Andrea Vedaldi. "*Weakly supervised deep detection networks*." Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2016. [Link](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/publications/2016/Bilen16/bilen16.pdf)

You should read these papers first. We will train and test using the [PASCAL VOC 2007](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2007/index.html) data. The Pascal VOC dataset comes with bounding box annotations, however, we will not use bounding box annotations in the weakly supervised setting. 

In all the following tasks, coding and analysis, please write a short summary of what you tried, what worked (or didn't), and what you learned, in the report. Write the code into the files as specified. Submit a zip file (`ANDREWID.zip`) with all the code files, and a single `REPORT.pdf`, which should have commands that TAs can run to re-produce your results/visualizations etc. Also mention any collaborators or other sources used for different parts of the assignment.


## Software Setup

If you are using AWS instance setup using the provided instructions, you should already have most of the requirements installed on your machine. In any case, you would need the following Python libraries installed:

1. PyTorch
2. Weights and Biases
3. SKLearn
4. Pillow (PIL)
5. And many tiny dependencies that come pre-installed with anaconda or can be installed using ``conda install`` or ``pip install``

### Activate conda pytorch environment.
```bash
$ conda activate vlrhw2
```
### Some conda packages can only be installed from conda-forge (e.g. opencv). So we will be appending conda-forge channel into our conda channels
```bash
$ conda config --append channels conda-forge
```

### Now we'll install the packages we need to run this assignment.
```
$ conda install -c anaconda scikit-learn
$ conda install -c conda-forge wandb
```

### Data setup
1. Similar to Assignment 1, we first need to download the image dataset and annotations. If you already have the data from the last assignment, you can skip this step. Use the following commands to setup the data, and lets say it is stored at location `$DATA_DIR`.
```bash
$ # First, cd to a location where you want to store ~0.5GB of data.
$ wget http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2007/VOCtrainval_06-Nov-2007.tar
$ tar xf VOCtrainval_06-Nov-2007.tar
$ # Also download the test data
$ wget http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2007/VOCtest_06-Nov-2007.tar && tar xf VOCtest_06-Nov-2007.tar
$ cd VOCdevkit/VOC2007/
$ export DATA_DIR=$(pwd)
```
2. In the main folder of the code provided in this repository, there is an empty directory with the name `data`. 
	- In this folder, you need to create a link to `VOCdevkit` in this folder. 
	- If you read WSDDN paper [2], you should know that it requires bounding box proposals from Selective Search, Edge Boxes or a similar method. We provide you with this data for the assignment. You need to put these proposals in the data folder too.
	
```bash
# You can run these commands to populate the data directory
$ # First, cd to the main code folder
$ # Then cd to the data folder
$ cd data/VOCdevkit/VOC2007/
$ # Download the selective search data
$ wget http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~spurushw/hw2_files/selective_search_data.tar && tar xf selective_search_data.tar
```
Alternatively, the selective search data can also be found at the following link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jRQOlAYKNFgS79Q5q9kfikyGE91LWv1I

## Task 0: Visualization and Understanding the Data Structures [10 pts]
We will be building on code from the previous assignment, this time to include information about bounding boxes and region proposals in our dataloaders.

### Modifying the Dataloader #
You will have to modify the VOCDataset class in `voc_dataset.py` to return bounding boxes, classes corresponding to the bounding boxes, as well as selective search region proposals. Check the `TODO` in `voc_dataset.py` and make changes wherever necessary. Once this is done, you will use Wandb to visualize the bounding boxes. The file `task_0.ipynb` has detailed instructions for this task.

#### Q 0.1: What classes does the image at index 2020 contain (index 2020 is the 2021-th image due to 0-based numbering)? [2 pts]
#### Q 0.2: You might have noticed that each image has a certain number of proposals from selective search. Often, this number is a lot more than we require. What is the easiest way to select the most informative regions? (Hint: look at the scores corresponding to each proposal in `voc_2007_trainval.mat`). [2 pts]
#### Q 0.3 Use Wandb to visualize the ground-truth bounding box and the class for the image at index 2020. [3 pts]
#### Q 0.4 Use Wandb to visualize the top ten bounding box proposals for the image at index 2020. [3 pts]


## Task 1: Is Object Localization Free? [50 pts]

A good way to dive into using PyTorch is training a simple classification model on ImageNet. 
We won't be doing that to save the rainforest (and AWS credits) but you should take a look at the code [here](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/blob/master/imagenet/main.py). We will be following the same structure.

The code for the model is in `AlexNet.py`. In the code, you need to fill in the parts that say "TODO" (read the questions before you start filling in code). 
We need to define our model in one of the "TODO" parts. We are going to call this ``LocalizerAlexNet``. I've written a skeleton structure in `AlexNet.py`. You can look at the AlexNet example of PyTorch. For simplicity and speed, we won't be copying the FC layers to our model. We want the model to look like this:
```text
LocalizerAlexNet(
  (features): Sequential(
    (0): Conv2d(3, 64, kernel_size=(11, 11), stride=(4, 4), padding=(2, 2))
    (1): ReLU(inplace)
    (2): MaxPool2d(kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(2, 2), dilation=(1, 1), ceil_mode=False)
    (3): Conv2d(64, 192, kernel_size=(5, 5), stride=(1, 1), padding=(2, 2))
    (4): ReLU(inplace)
    (5): MaxPool2d(kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(2, 2), dilation=(1, 1), ceil_mode=False)
    (6): Conv2d(192, 384, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1), padding=(1, 1))
    (7): ReLU(inplace)
    (8): Conv2d(384, 256, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1), padding=(1, 1))
    (9): ReLU(inplace)
    (10): Conv2d(256, 256, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1), padding=(1, 1))
    (11): ReLU(inplace)
  )
  (classifier): Sequential(
    (0): Conv2d(256, 256, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1))
    (1): ReLU(inplace)
    (2): Conv2d(256, 256, kernel_size=(1, 1), stride=(1, 1))
    (3): ReLU(inplace)
    (4): Conv2d(256, 20, kernel_size=(1, 1), stride=(1, 1))
  )
)
```

#### Q 1.1 Fill in each of the TODO parts except for the functions ``metric1``, ``metric2`` and ``LocalizerAlexNetRobust``. In the report, for each of the TODO, describe the functionality of that part. The output of the above model has some spatial resolution. Make sure you read paper [1] and understand how to go from the output to an image level prediction (max-pool). (Hint: This part will be implemented in ``train()`` and ``validate()``. [2 pts]

#### Q 1.2 What is the output resolution of the model? [3 pts]

#### Plotting using Weights and Biases
Logging to [Weights and Biases](https://docs.wandb.ai/quickstart), also known as `wandb` is quite easy and super useful. You can use this to keep track of experiment hyperparameters and metrics such as loss/accuracy.
```python
import wandb
wandb.init(project="vlr-hw2")
# logging the loss
wandb.log({'epoch': epoch, 'loss': loss})
```
You can also use it to save models, perform hyperparameter tuning, share your results with others, collate different runs together and other cool stuff. 

When you're logging to WandB, make sure you use good tag names. For example, for all training plots you can use ``train/loss``, ``train/metric1``, etc and for validation ``validation/metric1``, etc.

#### Q 1.3 Initialize the model from ImageNet (till the conv5 layer). Initialize the rest of layers with Xavier initialization and train the model using batchsize=32, learning rate=0.01, epochs=2 (Yes, only 2 epochs for now).(Hint: also try lr=0.1 - best value varies with implementation of loss) [10 pts]
- Use wandb to plot the training loss curve.
- Use wandb to plot images and the rescaled heatmaps for only the GT classes for 2 batches (1 images in each batch) in every epoch (uniformly spaced in iterations).

#### Q 1.4 In the first few iterations, you should observe a steep drop in the loss value. Why does this happen? (Hint: Think about the labels associated with each image). [2 pts]

#### Q 1.5 We will log two metrics during training to see if our model is improving progressively with iterations. The first metric is a standard metric for multi-label classification. Do you remember what this is? Write the code for this metric in the TODO block for ``metric1`` (make sure you handle all the boundary cases). However, ``metric1`` is to some extent not robust to the issue we identified in Q1.4. The second metric, Recall, is more tuned to this dataset. Even though there is a steep drop in loss in the first few iterations ``metric2`` should remain almost constant. Implement it in the TODO block for ``metric2``. (Make any assumptions needed - like thresholds). [3 pts]

### We're ready to train now!

#### Q 1.6 Initialize the model from ImageNet (till the conv5 layer), initialize the rest of layers with Xavier initialization and train the model using batchsize=32, learning rate=0.01, epochs=30. Evaluate every 2 epochs. (Hint: also try lr=0.1 - best value varies with implementation of loss) \[Expected training time: 45mins-75mins].  [15 pts]
- IMPORTANT: FOR ALL EXPERIMENTS FROM HERE - ENSURE THAT THE SAME IMAGES ARE PLOTTED ACROSS EXPERIMENTS BY KEEPING THE SAMPLED BATCHES IN THE SAME ORDER. THIS CAN BE DONE BY FIXING THE RANDOM SEEDS BEFORE CREATING DATALOADERS.
- Use wandb to plot the training loss curve, training ``metric1``, training ``metric2`` [2.5 pts]
- Use wandb to plot the mean validation ``metric1`` and mean validation ``metric2`` for every 2 epochs. [2.5 pts]
- Use wandb to plot images and the rescaled heatmaps for only the GT classes for 2 batches (1 images in each batch) at the end of the 1st, 15th, and last(30th) epoch. [4 pts]

- At the end of training, use wandb to plot 3 randomly chosen images and corresponding heatmaps (similar to above) from the validation set. [3 pts]
- In your report, mention the training loss, training and validation ``metric1`` and ``metric2`` achieved at the end of training. [3 pts]


#### Q 1.7 In the heatmap visualizations you observe that there are usually peaks on salient features of the objects but not on the entire objects. How can you fix this in the architecture of the model? (Hint: during training the max-pool operation picks the most salient location). Implement this new model in ``LocalizerAlexNetRobust`` and also implement the corresponding ``localizer_alexnet_robust()``. Train the model using batchsize=32, learning rate=0.01, epochs=45. Evaluate every 2 epochs.(Hint: also try lr=0.1 - best value varies with implementation of loss)
- Hints:
    - You do not have to change the backbone AlexNet for implementing this. Think about how the network may try to use certain salient parts of the object more and what maybe a quick and easy way to prevent it.
- For this question only visualize images and heatmaps using wandb at similar intervals as before (ensure that the same images are plotted). [5 pts]
- You don't have to plot the rest of the quantities that you did for previous questions (if you haven't put flags to turn off logging the other quantities, it's okay to log them too - just don't add them to the report).
- At the end of training, use wandb to plot 3 randomly chosen images (same images as Q1.6) and corresponding heatmaps from the validation set. [5 pts]
- Report the training loss, training and validation ``metric1`` and ``metric2`` achieved at the end of training. [5 pts]


## Task 2: Weakly Supervised Deep Detection Networks [40 pts]

First, make sure you understand the WSDDN model. 

The main script for training is ``task_2.py``.  Read all the comments to understand what each part does. There are a few major components that you need to work on:

- The network architecture and functionality ``WSDDN``
- Writing the traning loop and including visualizations for metrics
- The function `test_net()` in `task_2.py`, which will log metrics on the test set

Tip for Task 2: conda install tmux, and train in a tmux session. That way you can detach, close your laptop (don't stop your ec2 instance!), and go enjoy a cookie while you wait.

#### Q2.1 In ``wsddn.py``, you need to complete the  ``__init__, forward`` and `` build_loss`` functions. 
The `__init__()` function will be used to define the model. You can define 3 parts for the model
1. The feature extractor
2. A ROI-pool layer (use torchvision.ops)
3. A classifier layer, as defined in the WSDDN paper.

The `forward()` function will essentially do the following:
1. Extract features from a given image (notice that batch size is 1 here). Feel free to use AlexNet code as backbone from the first part of the assignment.
2. Use the regions proposed from Selective Search, perform ROI Pooling. There are 2 caveats here - ensure that the proposals are now absolute values of pixels in the input image, and ensure that the scale factor passed into the ROI Pooling layer works correctly for the given image and features [ref](https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/spatial-scale-in-torchvision-ops-roi-pool/59270).
    - Note that for the scale factor in ROI Pooling closely depends on the coordinate values in your ROIs (i.e. wether these values are scaled or not). Make sure you understand the ROI pooling API when using this function.
4. For each image, ROI Pooling gives us a feature map for the proposed regions. Pass these features into the classifier subnetwork. Here, you can think of batch size being the number of region proposals for each image.
5. Combine the classifier outputs (for boxes and classes), which will give you a tensor of shape (N_boxes x 20). Return this.

The `build_loss()` function now computes classification loss, which can be accessed in the training loop.


#### Q2.2 In ``task_2.py`` you will first need to write the training loop.
This involves creating the dataset, calling the dataloaders, etc. and then finally starting the training loop with the forward and backward passes. Some of this functionality has already been implemented for you. Ideally, use the hyperparameters given in the code. You don't need to implement the visualizations yet.
Use `top_n=300`, but feel free to increase it as well.

#### Q2.3 In ``task_2.py``, you now need to write a function to test your model, and visualize its predictions.
1. Write a test loop similar to the training loop, and calculate mAP as well as class-wise AP's.

At this point, we have our model giving us (N_boxes x 20) scores. We can interpret this as follows - for each of the 20 classes, there are `N` boxes, which have confidence scores for that particular class. Now, we need to perform Non-Max Suppression for the bbox scores corresponding to each class.
- In `utils.py`, write the NMS function. NMS depends on the calculation of Intersection Over Union (IoU), which you can either implement as a separate function, or vectorize within the NMS function itself. Use an IoU threshold of 0.3.
- Use NMS with a confidence threshold of 0.05 (basically consider only confidence above this value) to remove unimportant bounding boxes for each class.
- In the test code, iterate over indices for each class. For each class, visualize the NMSed bounding boxes with the class names and the confidence scores. You can use wandb for this, but if using ImageDraw or something else is more convenient, feel free to use that instead.


#### Q2.4 In ``task_2.py``, there are places for you perform visualization (search for TODO). You need to perform the appropriate visualizations mentioned here:
- Plot the loss every 500 iterations (feel free to use the AverageMeter class from `task_1.py`) using wandb. [5 pts]
- Use wandb to plot mAP on the *test* set every epoch. [5 pts]
- Plot the class-wise APs at every epoch. [10 pts]
- Plot bounding boxes on 10 random images at the end of the first epoch, and at the end of the last epoch. (You can visualize for more images, and choose whichever ones you feel represent the learning of the network the best. It's also interesting to see the kind of mistakes the network makes as it is learning, and also after it has learned a little bit!) [10 pts]


#### Q2.5 Train the model using the hyperparameters provided for 5-6 epochs.
The expected values for the metrics at the end of training are:
- Train Loss: ~1.0
- Test  mAP : ~0.13

Some caveats for Train loss and Test mAP:
- If your loss does not go down or is too unstable, try lowering the learning rate. 
- In case you have tried a lot and still cannot get a loss around ~1.0 then add *one plot for all of your valid tries* and add it to the report. Also, add 2-3 lines on what you believe is the reason for the observed behavior.
- Test AP (for detection) can show variance across different classes hence look at the mean value (mAP).

Include all the code and images/logs after training.
Report the final class-wise AP on the test set and the mAP. [10 pts]
